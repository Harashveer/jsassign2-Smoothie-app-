<!-- All the images I used in this assignment are ai generated : image generator 
By naif alotaibi

Most of the ideas, design decisions, and feature concepts in this project are mine. 
I used Ai mainly to help refine the code, fix bugs, and get suggestions on how 
to implement the things I wanted to build. As I mentioned before some stuff, like the background or fruit 
images, was generated using AI tools to match the look I was going for. 
Overall, the direction and creativity came from me.

Ill try to metion these things on specifc line of code as much as I can
